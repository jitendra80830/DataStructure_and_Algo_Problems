    //Problem Statement
    //
    //Three players play a game against each other.
    //
    //Initially, each player had 0 points. They played at least one round. For each round: • The first place gets 10 points • The second place gets 5 points • The third place (last place) gets 1 point
    //
    //You want, the 1st player gets exactly A points, the 2nd player gets exactly B points and the 3rd player gets exactly C points. Is it possible or not?
    //
    //Constraints 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= A, B, C <= 120 3 <= A+B+C <= 120
    //
    //Input Format
    //
    //The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. A single line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B, and C.
    //
    //Output Format
    //
    //For each test case, if is it possible, print ‘YES’, otherwise print ‘NO’.
    //
    //Sample Input
    //
    //3 10 1 5 21 15 12 4 5 7
    //
    //Sample Output
    //
    //YES YES NO
    //
    //Explanation of Sample
    //
    //Sample case 1: In the first round if, the 1st player place 1st position, 2nd player place 3rd position, and 3rd player place 2nd position then all player score is {10,1,5}. So, the answer is yes.

    //Things to Note for the Candidate
    //
    //• You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code. • The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution. • Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output. • Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
